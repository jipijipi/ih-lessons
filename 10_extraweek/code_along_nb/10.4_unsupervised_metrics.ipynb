    "# Metrics for Evaluating Unsupervised Learning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluating unsupervised learning models, such as clustering algorithms like KMeans and HDBSCAN, is crucial to determine the quality of the clusters formed. Unlike supervised learning, where we have ground truth labels to compare against, unsupervised learning requires different metrics to assess the performance.\n",

    "## Common Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Silhouette Score**\n",
    "2. **Calinski-Harabasz Index**\n",
    "3. **Davies-Bouldin Index**\n",
    "\n",
    "We will explain each metric and provide examples of how to compute them using Python.\n"
