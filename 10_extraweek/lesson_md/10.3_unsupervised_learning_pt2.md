## Learning Outcomes

- Gain proficiency in using different Unsupervised Learning Algorithms 
- Grasp the differences between several evaluation metrics and use them to evaluate models

## Hands on Lesson

The Jupyter Notebook with empty code cells so you can do Code Along can be found here: **[Unsupervised Learning PT2Code Along](https://github.com/data-bootcamp-v4/lessons/blob/main/7_ml/code_along_nb/10.4_unsupervised_metrics.ipynb)**

The complete Jupyter Notebook that will be used through out the Hands On Lesson can be found here: **[Unsupervised Learning PT2](https://github.com/data-bootcamp-v4/lessons/blob/main/7_ml/code_along_nb/10.4_unsupervised_metrics.ipynb)**
